Provides a Java API to parse and collect code coverage results. This API is a companion module for the 
[Static Analysis Model and Parsers Library](https://github.com/jenkinsci/analysis-model) that does the same kind
of thing for static analysis results. See the 
Jenkins [Code Coverage Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/code-coverage-api-plugin) to see on how to use this API
in practice.
